The most important (highest counts) gcov files are, in decreasing order:
lifeseq.c.gcov
util.h.gcov // contains static inline funcitons mod and alivep used in lifeseq
load.c.gcov // read from file
save.c.gcov // store in file


Other files that only have lines/branches that execute once:
gol.c.gcov  // runs main function and calls life.c->lifeseq.c
life.c.gcov // just calls lifeseq.c
